# A manifesto for reproducible science

## Discussion of

Munafò, M. R., Nosek, B. A., Bishop, D. V. M., Button, K. S., Chambers, C. D., Sert, N. P. du, … Ioannidis, J. P. A. (2017). A manifesto for reproducible science. *Nature Human Behaviour*, *1*, 0021. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021>.

## Steps in scientific method (and weaknesses)

- Generate and specify hypothesis
- Design study
- Conduct study and collect data
- Analyze data and test hypothesis
- Interpret results
- Publish and/or conduct next study

```

## Failure to control for bias

- [*Apophenia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia)
    - Mistaking connections and meaning between unrelated things
- Confirmation bias
- Hindsight bias
- [[@Kahneman2013-zi]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)

## Low statistical power

- [[@Button2013-ox]](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn3475)
- [[@ioannidis_why_2005]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/figure/image?size=large&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000797.g003")
```

## Poor quality control

- [[@goodman_what_2016]](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)

- *Methods* reproducibility

> *"…the ability to implement, as exactly as possible, the experimental and computational procedures, with the same data and tools, to obtain the same results."*

## *p*-Hacking

- [[@Simonsohn2014-tt]](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0033242)
- If an effect is *true*, the distribution of reported *p* values should be right-skewed (long right tail)
- <https://www.p-curve.com/>

## HARKing: hypothesizing after the results are known

- [[@Kerr1998-zg]](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4)
- Find an effect in data analysis
- Present effect as if it had been hypothesized
- Why is this problematic?

## Publication bias

- Results vs. null findings
- Novel results vs. replications
- Counter-intuitive (sexy) findings
- [File drawer effect](https://www.psychfiledrawer.org/TheFiledrawerProblem.php)
    - How many unpublished failures to replicate sit in file drawers?
    
# Overcoming these weaknesses

## Performing research

- Protecting against cognitive biases
- Improving methodological training
- Implementing independent methological support
- Encouraging collaboration and team science
- Collect bigger samples

## Reporting on research

- Promoting study pre-registration
    - Registered reports [[@munafo_manifesto_2017]](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021), Box 3
- Improving the quality of reporting
    - [The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines](https://osf.io/ud578/) and [signatories](https://cos.io/top/#list)

## Reporting on research

> "*We find that about 40% of studies fail to fully report all experimental conditions and about 70% of studies do not report all outcome variables included in the questionnaire. Reported effect sizes are about twice as large as unreported effect sizes and are about 3 times more likely to be statistically significant.*"

--- [[@Franco2016-yu]](https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550615598377)

## Reporting on research

- Publish replications
- Teach with replications
  - [[@Frank2012-fc]](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612460686).

## Verifying research

- Promoting transparency and open science
- Open methods, materials, code sharing, data sharing 

## Changing Incentives

- [[@higginson_current_2016]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000995)
  - Claim that current publication incentive structure reinforces current practices
- [OSF badge system](https://osf.io/tvyxz/)
- Other incentives/disincentives

## Status report/recommendations by stakeholder group

<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021/tables/1>

## Questions for discussion

- Which of the manifesto provisions would you **disagree** with?
- Do you agree with the assessment about progress ([Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021/tables/1))
- What steps could **you** take?

# Reproducible workflows

## One step forward

- Capturing workflows and improving **methods** reproducibility [[@goodman_what_2016]](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)

## [Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow)

<https://www.google.com/search?q=workflow>

## Typical workflows in experimental psychology

- Idea/question/hypotheses
- Design study
- Seek ethics board permission
- Build/borrow/buy data collection instruments
- Run study
- Analyze results
- Write-up results for presentation and/or publication

## Design study

- Participants
    + Number, characteristics
- Setting(s)
    + Lab, classroom, home

---

- Measures or tasks
    + Self/other report
    + Observations/video or audio recording
    + Physiological measures (MRI, EEG, ECG)
    + Computer-based tasks
    
## Power analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

power_to_df <- function(x) {
  df <- data.frame(n1 = x$n1, n2 = x$n2, d = x$d, sig.level = x$sig.level, power = x$power, alternative = x$alternative)
  df
}

power_from_p_male <- function(p_male) {
  n_male <- p_male*300
  n_female <- 300 - n_male
  pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n_male, n_female, sig.level = 0.0125, 
                    power = .8, alternative = "greater")
}

pow_calc <- function(p_male) {
  power_to_df(power_from_p_male(p_male))
}

purrr::map_dfr(1/(2:8), pow_calc) %>%
  dplyr::rename(., n_males = n1) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(.) + 
  ggplot2::aes(n_males, d) + 
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Effect size detectable at .8 power, n_tot=300")
```


## Data collection instruments

- Surveys
- Video/audio
- MRI, EEG, ECG
- Computer-generated data files

## Run study

```
done_collecting_data = FALSE
while (!done_collecting_data) {
  Collect_sample()
  if (collected_sample_n >= planned_sample_n) {
    done_collecting_data = TRUE
  } else {
    done_collecting_data = FALSE
  }
}
```

## Analyze results 

- Clean/check data
- Merge, combine, munge data

----

<div class="centered">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("
      digraph {
      layout = dot
      node [shape = square]
      Analyze -> Evaluate
      Evaluate -> Analyze
      }")
```
</div>

## Prepare presentation/publication

- Intro
- Methods
- Results
    + Stats
    + Plots
- Conclusions
- References
- Data?

## Behavioral study summary

<div class="centered">
```{r grViz, echo=FALSE}

# Helpful site: https://mikeyharper.uk/flowcharts-in-r-using-diagrammer/

grViz("
      digraph {
      graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
      node [shape = circle, fillcolor = Linen]
      
      # Nod definitions
      E1, E2, En [shape = circle]
      S1, S2, Sn [shape = square]
      XL1, XL2, XLn, XLall  [shape = folder]
      Stat [shape = triangle]
      MSWd, Ppt [shape = rectangle]
      
      # Edge definitions
      E1 -> XL1
      S1 -> XL1
      E2 -> XL2
      S2 -> XL2
      En -> XLn
      Sn -> XLn
      {XL1, XL2, XLn} -> XLall
      XLall -> Stat
      Stat -> {XLplot, MSWd, Ppt}
      XLplot -> {MSWd, Ppt}
      }")
```
</div>

## Imaging example

<div class="centered">

```{r grViz-2, echo=FALSE}
grViz("
      digraph {
      graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
      
      # Node defaults
      node [shape = circle]
      
       [shape = folder, fillcolor = Linen]
      BOLD, DTI [shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
      MNI  [shape = folder, fillcolor = Linen]
      Plot, Stats [shape = rectangle]
      MSWd, Ppt [shape = oval]
      
      # Edge structure
      {T1, MNI} -> StrNorm
      {BOLD, StrNorm} -> BOLDNorm
      {Behavior, BOLDNorm} -> FuncBeh
      {DTI, StrNorm} -> DTINorm
      {FuncBeh, Demog, DTINorm} -> Part
      Part -> {Plot, Stats}
      Stats -> {MSWd, Ppt}
      Plot -> {MSWd, Ppt}
      }")
```
</div>

## Threats to **methods** reproducibility

- Idea/question/hypotheses
- Design study
- Seek ethics board permission
- Build/borrow/buy **data collection instruments**
- **Run study**
- **Analyze results**
- **Write-up results** for presentation and/or publication

## What are the threats?

- Data collection instruments
- Running study
- Data analysis
- Study write-up

## Mitigating the threats

- Maximize consistency, **methods** reproducibility [[@goodman_what_2016]](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)
- Design/consistent adhere to detailed experimental protocols
- Make workflows consistent, transparent
- Organize data, metadata in consistent, transparent ways
- Minimize human/hand data entry
- Automate as much as possible

## How detailed is your (internal) protocol?

- Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) project [wiki](https://play-project.org)
- Sex differences in visual perception [master protocol](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/sex-differences-in-motion-perception/protocol/master-protocol.html), [testing protocol](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/sex-differences-in-motion-perception/protocol/test-session-protocol.html)

## Questions to consider

- What data and metadata am I collecting?
- How does it get collected?
- Where does it go after it's collected?
- How does my non-electronic data get transferred to an electronic form?
- How do my electronic data files get cleaned, merged, munged?

## Reproducible workflow aspirations

- "Chain of custody" from raw data to finished results and figures
- Single command to regenerate all results and figures from raw data

<https://datasci.kitzes.com/lessons/python/reproducible_workflow.html>

## Reproducible workflow recommendations

- Create consistent structure for projects
    + Use file name conventions
- Use machine-readable file types
    + comma-separated value (.csv) vs. .xlsx
- Automate as much as possible
- Use version control

## Lots of ways to organize electronic data...

<https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/2>

## [ProjectTemplate](https://projecttemplate.net/index.html)

- Automates some of the project management involved in data analysis
    + Hat Tip (HT): Michael Hallquist
- Gilmore says: Use what you like

## Can automate project creation, too

```
## Create project directory
proj_name = "tmp_proj"
if (!exists(proj_name)) {
  dir.create(path = proj_name, recursive = TRUE)
}
# Create sessions directory
sessions_dir = paste(proj_name, "analysis/sessions", sep="/")
if (!exists(sessions_dir)) {
  dir.create(path = sessions_dir, recursive = TRUE) # creates intermediate dirs
}
# Aggregate data file directory
agg_dir = paste(proj_name, "analysis/aggregate", sep="/")
if (!exists(agg_dir)) {
  dir.create(path = agg_dir, recursive = TRUE)
}
```

## Words to the wise

- Use consistent file/directory names
    + `lowerCamelCaseIsGood.txt` so is `UpperCamelCase.txt`
    + `underscores_between_words.txt` works
    + `dashes-between.txt` works for *file* names, but...
        - Doesn't work for objects in `R`
        - `file-name.txt` interpreted as `file` minus `name.txt`
    + avoid `spaces in your file names.txt`; these are not always reliably readable by all computers.

---

- Choose good, [descriptive names](https://kbroman.org/dataorg/pages/names.html)

## Consider seriously [Karl Broman's guides](https://kbroman.org/dataorg/)

- Be consistent
- Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Fill-in all cells
- One thing in a cell
- Make your data a rectangle
- Create a data dictionary

---

- No calculations in raw data files
- No font or color to highlight data
- Make back-ups
- Validate data to avoid data entry errors
- Save data in plain text files (comma or tab-delimited)

## Why?

- Data scientists (that's you!) spend a lot of time just cleaning data
- <https://www.infoworld.com/article/3047584/big-data/hottest-job-data-scientists-say-theyre-still-mostly-digital-janitors.html>

## Easy to merge data sets if they contain a linking variable (like subID)

- [study-1-demo-agg.csv](csv/study-1-demo-agg.csv) contains
    + subID, sex, ageYrs, favColor
- [study-1-rt-agg.csv](csv/study-1-rt-agg.csv) contains
    + subID, condition, rt
    
----

```
subID,sex,ageYrs,favColor
001,m,53,green
002,f,51,blue
003,f,23,red
004,m,25,aqua
```

Don't put spaces between variables in comma-separated value (.csv) files.
Also, make sure to add a final line feed/enter character.

----

```
subID,condition,rt
001,upright,250
001,inverted,300
002,upright,225
002,inverted,290
003,upright,270
003,inverted,230
004,upright,210
004,inverted,240
```
    
----

```{r data-import-example, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# read data files, first row (header) contains variable names
demo <- read.csv(file = "csv/study-1-demo-agg.csv", header = TRUE)
rt <- read.csv(file = "csv/study-1-rt-agg.csv", header = TRUE)

# merge and print
merged <- merge(demo, rt, by = "subID")
merged
```

## A final word about tidy data [[@hadley_wickham_tidy_2014]](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)

- Variables in columns
- Observations in rows
- ~~Ok~~/better to repeat values in columns
    + subID,trial,rt
    + 001,1,300
    + 001,2,345
    + 002,2,327
    
## Reproducible workflows allow on-line QA

- QA = quality assurance
- Example 1: QA on PLAY project (Rick use local copies)
- Example 2: [QA report](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/sex-differences-in-motion-perception/analysis/session_qa.html) on sex differences project
- Example 3: Individual plots from sex differences project (Rick use local copies)

## Main points

- Think like a computer!
- Plan your work; work your plan
- Consistency, standard formats
- Tidy data
- Haven't said anything about "openness"...yet

---

- (Methods) reproducible workflows are much easier to share
