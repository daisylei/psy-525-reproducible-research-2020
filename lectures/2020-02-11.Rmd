<!-- # Prelude -->

# Preliminaries

## Announcements

- Women in Statistics and Data Science group, Monday February 10th, 12-1pm, 327 Thomas
- [Institute for Computational and Data Science (ICDS) events](https://ics.psu.edu/news-events/events/)
- ["The Data Deluge", ICDS Symposium, March 16-17, 2020](https://ics.psu.edu/news-events/events/icds-symposium-2020/), NLI.

## Today's agenda

- General comments on homework
- Version control
- Version control with git and GitHub
- RStudio projects

# Comments on homework

## Things to consider

- Where are my data stored?
    - Can I create a reproducible workflow for importing them?
- Automate as much as possible
- Use names that are transparent to others

---

- What are your document's dependencies, e.g. packages, external scripts or functions
- Make your code as readable as possible.
    - Consider `<COMMAND/CTRL>I` to reindent lines
    - `<SHIFT><COMMAND/CTRL>A` to reformat code
- Plot first, analyze later
  
# Version control

## What is version control?

- "management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information." <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>
- Track changes an example
- Wikipedia another

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://whatdoidowithmylife.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/drawing-board.jpg")
```

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://smutch.github.io/VersionControlTutorial/_images/vc-xkcd.jpg")
```

## Why do version control?

- Keep record of who made what changes when
- Revert to previous version
- Transparency

## How to do version control

## [Edit, Save, Attach](http://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#what-is-the-payoff)

- My typical scheme for collaborative writing
- Requires consistent file-naming (and incrementing) conventions
    + gilmore-etal-nature-2017-01-28-1319.docx
    + gilmore-etal-nature-2017-01-28-1400.docx
    + or gilmore-etal-nature-2020-02-04v01.docx
    
## Pros
    
+ No special software needed
+ Works with every file type
+ Good for any file type

## Cons
    
+ Not everyone uses the same file naming conventions
+ Dealing with conflicts
+ File management

## Google Docs

- Gilmore, R.O., Diaz, M.T., Wyble, B.A., & Yarkoni, T. (2017). Progress toward openness, transparency, and reproducibility in cognitive neuroscience. *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*, *1396*, 5â€“18. doi: 10.1111/nyas.13325.

## Pros

+ Works with docs and sheets
+ Unlimited, automatic track changes
+ Stored in cloud
+ No special naming conventions
+ Writers can work in parallel

## Cons

+ NYAS Editor wanted Word doc with track changes!
+ Not all types of files
+ Not everyone likes/knows how to use Google docs
    
## Cloud storage (Box, OneDrive)

- Pros
    + Keep the same file name
    + Let Box or OneDrive do automatic versioning
    + Shared file space
    + Any kind of file supported
    
---

- Cons
    + limit on # of versions (was 100 for Box)
    + Penn State enterprise license
    
## [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io)

- Integrates with Box, Dropbox, GitHub
- Pros
    + Free, open source, devoted to open science
    + Many different file types
- Cons
    + Version control depends on storage sources

# Version control using git and GitHub

## How to do version control

- [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
    + free, open source version control system
    + created by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating system, to manage that project's software development
    
## [GitHub](http://github.com) is a web-based git service
    
+ [GitHub](http://github.com)
+ [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)
+ [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
    
## Cons

- Designed by and for software developers
- Text files
- Wonky
- Longevity of web-based repos?
- No automatic synching
- Users have to specifically push (upload), pull (download) files, merge/manage conflicts

## Pros

- Users have to specifically push (upload), pull (download) files, merge/manage conflicts
- Great for R code, ~~data~~
- Great for Jupyter notebooks (later in course)
- Exploits the power of the web

---

- Easy-to-use "Pages" feature
- Supports Markdown, Jupyter notebooks

---

```{r, out.width="700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control-fig3.png")
```

## Distributed version control

- Everyone works on their own local copies
- Pull before they start work
- Save and push when they're finished

## Learn from my mistakes

- Use RStudio projects (next)
- Have your local directory structure mirror GitHub
- Pull before you start working

---

- Work in a branch (I usually work in `dev`)
- Commit often
- Push to GitHub
- Create pull request to merge your changes into master

## Let's do this...

## Complete Hello World exercise

- Complete [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) exercise on GitHub

## Get git setup on your computer

- Install: <http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html>
- Tell git who you are: <http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html>

## Connect git to your GitHub account

- Instructions: <http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html>
- (if necessary; might not need to do this if you installed recently) Avoid authenticating each time by [caching credentials](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) or using [ssh keys](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html)

# RStudio Projects

## Projects

- Separate "home" directory for each piece of work
- Switch to using `Open Project...` command in `File` menu
- Saved metadata in *.Rproj (not saved on GitHub)

## Connect RStudio with git and GitHub

- Clone the Hello World repo, following these instructions: <http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#clone-the-new-github-repository-to-your-computer-via-rstudio>

## Create new RStudio project

- Instructions: <http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#new-rstudio-project-via-git-clone>
- GitHub repo first
- New RStudio project by cloning repo

## Rick's workflow

- Create repo on GitHub
- Copy link
- Open RStudio
- Create new project in RStudio

---

- Add `*.Rproj` to `.gitignore`
- Edit README.md
- Save and commit as 'first commit'
- Push to GitHub to test connection

## Learn from my mistakes

- Add sensitive files, directories to `.gitignore`

----
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
psy-525-reproducible-research-2020.Rproj
psy-525-spring-2020.csv
.databrary.RData
hw
----

## Real-life scenarios less radically open than mine

- Use git locally, but not push to GitHub
- Use RStudio projects, but not use git or GitHub
- Use private repository (limit of 3 collaborators/repo)

## Version control for RStudio Projects

- [packrat](http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/)
- Trying it again for this course. Progress report soon.

# Next time

---

- Simulation as a tool for reproducible and transparent science
- Visualization tools in R

# Resources

## Software

This talk was produced on `r Sys.Date()` in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) using R Markdown.
The code and materials used to generate the slides may be found at <https://github.com/psu-psychology/psy-525-reproducible-research-2020>.
Information about the R Session that produced the code is as follows:
```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
```
