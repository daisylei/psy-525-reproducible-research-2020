## Purpose

This document describes some of Rick's explorations with different RMarkdown themes for the course website.

Most of the examples come from those mentioned in  <https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/>.

For comparison purposes, I created a "child" document that comprises the schedule information and rendered it in all of the themes.
Modify the knitr chunk so that `child="schedule_raw.Rmd"` is one of the parameters.
