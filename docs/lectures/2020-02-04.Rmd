# Registration

## Registered reports

- What are they?
- Why are they a thing?
- Who's doing them?
- How they work and how to get involved

## What are they?

- Peer review and provisional acceptance of methodologically sound study proposals

## Why registered reports?

- Results (positive or null) don't determine publication (prevent publication bias)
- Reduce questionable practices
    + p-hacking
    + HARKing
    
## Why [**not**](http://www.cogsci.nl/blog/miscellaneous/215-the-pros-and-cons-of-pre-registration-in-fundamental-research) registered reports

- Restrict creativity in reporting "un-registered"/exploratory analyses?
    + Clearer communication about confirmatory vs. exploratory
- Mandatory vs. optional
- Clinical trials vs. fundamental research
- Exploration is not a dirty word

## Who's doing them?

- [Journals with Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/#journals) from COS
- How do they work?
    - Google sheet comparing features <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4_k-8C_UENTRtbPzXfhjEyu3BfLxdOsn9j-otrO870/edit#gid=0>

## [AsPredicted.org](https://aspredicted.org/)

- Standardized preregistration tool
- Separate confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- One author completes checklist, others receive email to approve
- Unique (private) URL to pdf
- Share when you like or never

## Your thoughts on registered reports, pregistration?

# Tools for reproducible workflows

## [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)

- An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

## Components of RStudio

- Code editor
- R console
- Integrated help
- Image viewer
- Integration with git and other version-control packages
- Project management

## R Markdown

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
    - Mark-up language to make it easy to write HTML
- R Markdown a special type of Markdown
    - Allows for ["literate" programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), mixing text, analysis, figures
    - Adds to Markdown syntax
    
## Let's do this...

- Open up RStudio
- Create a new R Markdown document
    - `File/New File/R Markdown...`

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-new-file.jpg")
```

---

- Select `Document`, call it something sensible like `psy-525-rmarkdown-testbed`
    - **NB**: This is the document's *title* not the name of the file.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-new-rmarkdown.jpg")
```

---

- Save the file as `testbed.Rmd`

## Anatomy of an R Markdown file

- Header
- Chunks
- Text, etc.

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown-testbed.jpg")
```


## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) syntax

- Text formatting
    + *italics* by surrounding text with single asterisks or underscores: `*italics*` or `_italics_`
    + **boldface** by surrounding text with double asterisks or underscores: `**boldface**` or `__boldface__`
    
---

- Text formatting
    + ~~strikethrough~~ by surrounding text with double tildes: `~~strikethrough~~`
    + [Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu) by surrounding link text with square brackets and URL with parentheses: 
    + ```[Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu)```

## Markdown syntax

- Paragraph formatting
    + Headings with level specified by the number of hash (#) marks
    + Lists (bullet and enumerated)
    + Block quotes
    + Code blocks
    
----

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
```

----

Code:
```markdown
- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item
```

- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item


----

Code:
```markdown
1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item
```

1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item

*Notice how the numbers are incremented automatically!*

## Learn from my mistakes...

- `<CTRL>+2` goes to console
- `<CTRL>+1` goes to source
- `<UP-ARROW>` `<RETURN>`
- `<COMMAND><ALT>+I` (Mac OS); `<CTRL><ALT>+I` (Windows) inserts a chunk
- Train your fingers now!

----

Code:
```markdown
> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President 
> spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.
```

> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.

## More on Markdown syntax

- Images can be inserted using this syntax `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)`
- Comments -- won't print in rendered output -- 
- `<!- This is a comment ->`

## R Markdown additions

- `.Rmd` extension
- Combine text, code, images, figures, video
- "Computable" reports, documents, slide shows, notebooks
- Code in "chunks"
- Output in multiple formats from the same file

## Make some data

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```

## Summary of x, y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```
````

```{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```

## Histogram of x

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
hist(x)
```
````

---

```{r}
hist(x)
```

## Histogram of y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
hist(y)
```
````

---

```{r}
hist(y)
```

## X vs. Y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
plot(x,y)
```
````

---

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

## Embed a figure using "chunk" syntax

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r rog, fig.cap="Rick's pic from Databrary"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nyu.databrary.org/party/6/avatar")
```
````

---

```{r rog, fig.cap="Rick's pic from Databrary"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nyu.databrary.org/party/6/avatar")
```

## Embed a figure using HTML

Code (outside a chunk):

`<img src="img/sleic.jpg" height=500px>`

Height parameter (or, e.g. `height=500px`) is optional, but useful. Remember Markdown -> HTML.

----

<img src="img/sleic.jpg" height=500px>

## Learn from my mistakes

- Don't change your working directory...*EVAH*!
- Give R Markdown document "local" paths
- Projects (next week) make this MUCH easier
- Talk to R *inside* chunks; talk to RStudio *outside* chunks
- Save your R Markdown file often

## Embed a YouTube video

HTML Code (outside a chunk--not talking to R)
```markdown
<iframe width="420" height="315" 
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" 
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

- YouTube gives you code to cut and paste to 'embed' a video.
- Just copy and paste

----

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Printing computed variables in your text

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x) # Figure out variable names for indexing
```
````

```{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x)       # Figure out variable names for indexing
```

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown-inline-code.jpg")
```

- Prefix inline code bits with "`r"
- Terminate inline code bits with single backtick "`"
- **No more copying and pasting statistical results!**

---

- Format numeric outputs with `sprintf()`
- `sprintf("%2.3f", 14.7666)` gives `r sprintf("%2.2f", 14.7666)`
- See `help("sprintf")`

----

*Index by variable name:* X lies within the range of [`r summ.x["Min."]`, `r summ.x["Max."]`].

*Index by numeric index:* The (y-x) difference in means is `r summ.y[4] - summ.x[4]`.

*Calculate and report:* The correlation between x and y is `r cor(x,y)`.

## Math equations 

Markdown (**not** in a chunk--not talking to R) using LaTex syntax.
```markdown
$$e=mc^{2}$$
```

$$e=mc^{2}$$

# Doing real work with R Markdown

## Use cases

- You want to give a talk based on your analysis
- You want to give a collaborator a report on your analysis in a format they prefer
- You don't want to duplicate effort

## Output options

- Document
    + HTML
        + Embedded or non-embedded figures
    + MS Word
    + PDF

---

- Presentation
    + HTML (ioslides)
    + HTML (Slidy)
    + PDF (Beamer)
    
---

- Shiny (interactive document)
    + Document
    + Presentation (ioslides)
- A website!

## All in your head(er)

- R Markdown documents have header text written in YAML
- [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) = YAML Ain't Markup Language

----

```yaml
---
title: "psy-525-rmarkdown-testbed"
author: "Rick Gilmore"
date: "`r Sys.time()`"
output:
  html_document:
    self_contained: true
  word_document:
    fig_width: 5
    fig_height: 5
    fig_caption: false
    df_print: kable
  pdf_document: default
  ioslides_presentation: default
  powerpoint_presentation: default
---
```

## Learn from my mistakes

- YAML syntax is specific
- Yes, the tabs and colons matter
- You can ~~have fun~~/waste a lot of time exploring YAML options

---

- OTOH, [**chunk** options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#code-chunk) are super useful
    - `echo=TRUE` prints your R code
    - `echo=FALSE` runs but does not print your code; `include=FALSE` does also.
    - `eval=FALSE` prevents a chunk from executing

## 'Knitting' vs. 'Rendering' your document

- Pressing the `knit` button converts your document to the default format
- That is, the first format after your `output:` parameter
- Pressing and holding the `knit` button gives other options
- `knitr` is an R package that R Markdown depends upon heavily

## Rendering your document

In the console (not your R Markdown document):
```yaml
> rmarkdown::render("testbed.Rmd")
```

## Why render?

- Saves time when editing interactively
    - Render, then switch to browser (alt-tab or command-tab)
    - Refresh browser
- Give documents parameters, like which output(s) you want

---

In the console:
```yaml
> rmarkdown::render("testbed.Rmd", 
output_format = c("html_document", "word_document", "pdf_document"))
```

Makes copies in three different formats: `testbed.html`, `testbed.docx`, and `testbed.pdf`.

## Other useful parameters for the `rmarkdown::render()` command

- `output_file = myslides.ioslides.html` or `output_file = myslides.slidy.html` to specify different output file targets.
- `output_dir = reports` or `output_dir = docx` to direct output to a specific directory.
- parameterized reports using `params:`

---

In your header:
````yaml
---
title: "psy-525-rmarkdown-testbed"
author: "Rick Gilmore"
date: "`r Sys.time()`"
output:
  html_document: default
params:
  name: Joe
  quest: "to find the Holy Grail"
---
````

- Single words don't require quotes; phrases with spaces do

---

In the console (for example):
````yaml
> rmarkdown::render("testbed.Rmd", params=list(name="Francine"))
````

## Some useful sets of YAML header parameters...

Make a self-contained HTML file that includes any plots you've made or graphics you've embedded.
Great for sharing locally (i.e, as a document not over the web).

````yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    self_contained: true
---
````

---

Add a table of contents. `toc_depth` controls how "deep" into your header hierarchy the table of contents should go.

````yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
---
````

---

Add `toc_float: true` to make the table of contents "float" to the side of your document.

````yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: true
---
````

---

Add `number_sections: true` to make the table of contents automatically generate a hierarchical set of numbers--1.0, 1.2, 2.1, etc.--based on your header hierarchy.
Remember, `#` is header 1, `##` is header 2, etc.

````yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
---
````

---

Include your code chunks (`include = TRUE`) but hide them until someone wants to see them by adding `code_folding: hide` to your YAML header.

````yaml
---
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
    code_folding: hide
---
````
